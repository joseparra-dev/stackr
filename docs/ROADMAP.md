Acceptance: Donut shows current allocation %. Historical chart shows portfolio value over selected timeframe. Holdings page shows quantity, avg cost, current value, P&L per asset.

## Week 5 — Polish

**Goal:** Production-grade UX. App feels finished.

- [ ] HU-19 — Empty states for all features
- [ ] HU-20 — Loading skeletons + error states
- [ ] HU-21 — i18n (en/es) with Angular i18n
- [ ] HU-22 — Accessibility audit + fixes (target Lighthouse a11y = 100)

Acceptance: Lighthouse Performance ≥ 90, A11y = 100, Best Practices ≥ 95. All states handled (loading, empty, error).

## Week 6 — Launch

**Goal:** Stackr is live, documented, and ready to be linked in your CV/LinkedIn.

- [ ] HU-23 — Settings page (theme, language, account)
- [ ] HU-24 — Sentry integration + Vercel deploy
- [ ] HU-25 — README polish + production deploy
- [ ] HU-26 — Zoneless change detection migration

Acceptance (HU-25): Live at `stackr.joseparra.dev` (or domain of choice). README has architecture, screenshots, decisions linked. LinkedIn post drafted.

Acceptance (HU-26): `provideZonelessChangeDetection()`, no `zone.js` polyfill, tests green (`pnpm test`, `pnpm build`). No `NavigatorLockAcquireTimeoutError` in dev console.

### Post-launch — Performance (HU-27 / HU-28)

- [ ] HU-27 — Lighthouse quick wins (robots.txt, self-hosted fonts, deferred chart)
- [ ] HU-28 — Lighthouse wave 2 (investigate + ChartCore, lazy Sentry, lazy i18n, strip deploy maps)

Acceptance (HU-28): Dashboard Lighthouse mobile ≥ 88 incognito; findings in `docs/perf-wave-2-findings.md`.

- [ ] HU-29 — Lighthouse wave 3 (CLS layout reservation, image alt, budget alignment)

Acceptance (HU-29): Dashboard CLS ≤ 0.1 incognito; findings in `docs/perf-wave-3-findings.md`.

## Future considerations (NOT in v1)

If you have new feature ideas during the build, add them here. Do not implement them in v1.

- Web3 wallet connection
- Live trading via exchange APIs
- DeFi positions (Aave, Compound, staking)
- NFTs
- Full tax reports (FIFO/LIFO/HIFO)
- Multi-currency display
- Push notifications / price alerts
- Social features
- Native mobile app via Capacitor
- Multi-portfolio per user
- CSV import from exchanges
- Reorganize `features/transactions/` into subfolders (`transaction-list/`, `utils/`) before holdings/filters add more files
- AI-powered investment insights
